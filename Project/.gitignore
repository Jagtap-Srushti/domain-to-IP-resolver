# 🌐 Domain to IP Resolver (Java)

A simple Java-based networking tool that resolves a domain name into its corresponding IP address using Java's `InetAddress` class.

This project demonstrates basic networking concepts in Java and allows users to resolve multiple domains in a single run.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Resolve domain names to IP addresses
- Display:
  - IP Address
  - Host Name
  - Canonical Host Name
- Continuous loop for multiple queries
- Exit option (`type 'exit'`)
- Basic exception handling for invalid domains

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java
- `java.net.InetAddress`
- `java.util.Scanner`
